                <h2>The Great Capton of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>
                    Imran Khan, a compelling figure in the realm of politics and sports, has significantly impacted both arenas. Before venturing into the political sphere, Khan was celebrated as one of cricket's greatest all-rounders, leading Pakistan to its first and only World Cup victory in 1992. His transition from sports to politics was marked by the same passion and determination he showed on the cricket field. Founding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996, Khan embarked on a challenging journey, facing initial setbacks but gradually gaining substantial support across the country. His anti-corruption stance and promise of a "Naya Pakistan" resonated with many, culminating in his election as the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2018. During his tenure, Khan focused on issues such as poverty alleviation, healthcare reform, and foreign policy, aiming to enhance Pakistan's stature on the global stage. Despite facing criticism and challenges, Imran Khan's legacy as a cricketer-turned-politician remains a testament to his enduring influence and ambition.
